## 88. Merge Sorted Array

### _Description_

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.


#### Example 1 :
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```

#### Example 2 :
```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
```

#### Example 2 :
```
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
```

#### Constraints:

- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
- <code>10<sup>9</sup> <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number} m
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
 */
var merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {
    let array = []
    array = nums1.slice(0,m).concat(nums2.slice(0,n)).sort(function(a,b){return a-b})

    for(i=0; i< m+n; i++){
        nums1[i] = array[i]
    }
};

```


```JavaScript
<!-- LeetCode Solution #1 -->
<!-- Runtime : 72 ms -->
<!-- Memory : 41.8 MB -->


var merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {
    for (let i = m, j = 0; j < n; i++, j++) {
        nums1[i] = nums2[j];
    }
    nums1.sort((a, b) => a - b);
};

```

### [Note] 
- My code uses temporary array to store the merged and sorted array, while the solution code modifies nums1 in-place without using additional space.
- Both codes have a time complexity of O((m+n)log(m+n)) due to the sorting step.
- In terms of efficiency and space complexity, the solution is slightly better since it avoids the creation of a temporary array.
- <strong>Note:</strong>
  * The function nums1.sort((a, b) => a - b) is used to sort the elements of the nums1 array in ascending order.
    * The sort() method in JavaScript is used to sort the elements of an array in place, meaning it modifies the original array. 
    * By default, the sort() method converts the elements of the array to strings and sorts them based on their **Unicode values**. However, when a comparison function is provided as an argument, it allows for **custom** sorting criteria.
    * In this case, the comparison function (a, b) => a - b is passed to the sort() method. This function subtracts b from a, resulting in a `negative` value if `a is less than b`, a `positive` value if `a is greater than b`, and `0` if they are `equal`.
    * By using this subtraction, the sort() method sorts the array in ascending order.
