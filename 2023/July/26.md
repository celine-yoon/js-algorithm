## 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array


### _Description_

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.




#### Example 1 :
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

#### Example 2 :
```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

#### Constraints:

- <code>1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- `100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

### [Note]
- These three codes implement the same functionality of removing duplicates from an array of numbers and returning the length of the modified array.
- Second code does not use the val variable to store the current value. It only uses the pointer variable to keep track of the index where the next unique value should be placed.
- Overall, the first code snippet uses an extra variable val to store the current value, while the second and third snippets directly compare the current element with the previous element. The third code snippet is more concise as it uses two pointers to accomplish the task.
