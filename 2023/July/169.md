## 169. Majority Element


### _Description_
Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.




#### Example 1 :
```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

#### Example 2 :
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```


#### Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- <code>1 <= n <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>

#### Follow up:
Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s1, s2, ...`, `sk` where k >= 10<sup>9</sup>, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
