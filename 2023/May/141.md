## 141. Linked List Cycle


### _Description_

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. <strong>Note that <code>pos</code> is not passed as a parameter.</strong>

Return `true` <i>if there is a cycle in the linked list</i>. Otherwise, return `false`.



#### Example 1 :

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

#### Example 2 :
![image](https://github.com/celine-yoon/js-algorithm/assets/126009067/c7f2cc9b-a2ad-4afe-b49c-8b9345515941)
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

#### Example 3 :
![image](https://github.com/celine-yoon/js-algorithm/assets/126009067/9cc9af7d-5b72-4089-8d48-4f4d1d40bfa7)
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

#### Constraints:

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range <code>[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
- <code>-10<sup>5</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.
