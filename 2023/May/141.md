## 141. Linked List Cycle


### _Description_

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. <strong>Note that <code>pos</code> is not passed as a parameter.</strong>

Return `true` <i>if there is a cycle in the linked list</i>. Otherwise, return `false`.



#### Example 1 :
![image](https://github.com/celine-yoon/js-algorithm/assets/126009067/50ff857f-9572-4052-9614-8c4ce03a32d4)
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

#### Example 2 :
![image](https://github.com/celine-yoon/js-algorithm/assets/126009067/c7f2cc9b-a2ad-4afe-b49c-8b9345515941)
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

#### Example 3 :
![image](https://github.com/celine-yoon/js-algorithm/assets/126009067/9cc9af7d-5b72-4089-8d48-4f4d1d40bfa7)
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

#### Constraints:

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range <code>[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
- <code>-10<sup>5</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;

 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var hasCycle = function(head) {
    let fast = head;
    let slow = head;

    while(fast && fast.next){
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next

        if(fast === slow){
            return true
        }
    }  
    return false
};

```

### [Note]
- I used the `two pointers method` to effectively identify cycles within a linked list.
- To begin, two pointers are employed: a fast pointer and a slow pointer. With each iteration, the fast pointer advances by two steps, while the slow pointer advances by a single step.
- Eventually, within a cycle, the fast pointer catches up to the slow pointer  since it moves twice as fast. If the two nodes become equal, it indicates the presence of a cycle. Conversely, if not, the pointers will never intersect, it signifies the absence of a cycle.
- This `two pointers pattern` is an essential technique that can be employed to address numerous linked list problems. Given its frequent occurrence, it is highly recommended to memorize this pattern.
