## 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists


### _Description_

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists in a one <strong>sorted</strong> list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return <i>the head of the merged linked list</i>.



#### Example 1 :

```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

#### Example 2 :
```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

#### Example 3 :
```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

#### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in <strong>non-decreasing</strong> order.
