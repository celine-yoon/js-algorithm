## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

### _Description_

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing <strong>a single day</strong> to buy one stock and choosing a <strong>different day in the future</strong> to sell that stock.

Return <i>the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction</i>. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.


#### Example 1 :
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

#### Example 2 :
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

#### Constraints:

- <code>1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>

           let profit = prices[j]-el;
           if (profit > max){
               max = profit
           }

            let profit = prices[right]-prices[left]
            max = Math.max(profit, max)
        }else{
            left = right;
        } right ++;
    }

### [Note] 
- We need to find out the maximum difference (the maximum profit) between two numbers in the given array. Also, the `right` number (selling price) must be larger than the `left` one (buying price).
- In formal terms, we need to find `max⁡(prices[j]−prices[i])`, for every `i` and `j` such that `j>i`.
- My solution employed the classic 'Brute Force' approach, which iterated through each number in the given array one by one, resulting in exceeding the time limit.
- LeetCode approached the problem by initializing the Left and Right pointers to the first and second positions of the array. The function executes a while loop that continues running until the Right pointer is less than the length of the array, updating the values for maximum profit as it progresses.
