## 1672. Richest Customer Wealth


### _Description_

You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `ith` customer has in the `jth` bank. Return _the <strong>wealth</strong> that the richest customer has._\
A customer's <strong>wealth</strong> is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.


#### Example 1 :
```
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
```

#### Example 2 :
```
Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10 
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
```

#### Example 3 :
```
Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
```

#### Constraints:

- `m == accounts.length`
- `n == accounts[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100`

    accounts.forEach(customer => {
        let sum = customer[0];
        if (customer.length>1){
        for(let i=1; i<customer.length; i++){
            customer[i] += customer[i-1];
            sum = customer[i]
        }}
        if (max < sum){
            max = sum;
        }
    })
    return max;
};

var maximumWealth = function(accounts) {
    let maxWealthSoFar = 0;

    accounts.forEach(customer => {
        let currentCustomerWealth=0;

        customer.forEach(bank => {
            currentCustomerWealth += bank;
        })
        
        maxWealthSoFar = Math.max(maxWealthSoFar, currentCustomerWealth);
    }
    )
    return maxWealthSoFar;
};

```




### [Note]
- Tried to use algorithm from [1480](https://github.com/celine-yoon/js-algorithm/blob/main/2023/Feb/1480.md)
- My solution had faster running time but need to write cleaner code.
- `if (max < sum){ max = sum; }` ===> `Math.max(max, sum)`
