## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters


### _Description_

Given a string `s`, find the length of the <strong>longest substring</strong> without repeating characters.
A <strong>Substring</strong> is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.


#### Example 1 :

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

#### Example 2 :
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

#### Example 3 :
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

#### Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
