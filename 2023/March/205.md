## 205. Isomorphic Strings


### _Description_

Given two strings `s` and `t`, <i>determine if they are isomorphic</i>.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.


#### Example 1 :
```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

#### Example 2 :
```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

#### Example 3 :
```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

#### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `t.length == s.length`
- `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.
