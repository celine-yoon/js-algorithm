## 383. Ransom Note


### _Description_

Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return `true` <i>if `ransomNote` can be constructed by using the letters from `magazine` and `false` otherwise.</i>

Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.


#### Example 1 :
```
Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false
```

#### Example 2 :
```
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false
```

#### Example 3 :
```
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true
```

#### Constraints:
- 1 <= ransomNote.length, magazine.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- `ransomNote` and `magazine` consist of lowercase English letters.

### [Note]
- When approaching problems were one needs to keep track of how frequently a certain element occurs, a `hashmap` is the perfect data structure to use!
- [Hashmap Image](https://interview-docs.com/docs/algorithms/images/String/hashmapTheDifference.png)
- Here are some useful `Hashmap` methods and properties:

`hashmap.size()` returns the # of elements in the hashmap \
`hashmap.get(<key>)` returns the value of the element of the given key \
`hashmap.has(<key>)` checks to see if the hashmap contains the key that is passed as an argument \
`hashmap.set(<key>, <value>)` accepts 2 arguments and creates a new element to the hashmap \
`hashmap.delete(<key>)` deletes the key/value pair that matches the key that is passed in as an argument \
`hashmap.clear()` clears all elements from the hashmap

- In the solution, we cut out each letter and put it in a `pile` of the same letter. This makes it much faster to find and see if we have a certain letter rather than looking through `magazine` from the start for the letter we want.
- In our problem, all we need for `magazine` are the <strong>frequency</strong> of its letters. Not the order they're in.

1. We must go through each letter of `magazine` once to put the characters into our `hashmap`.
2. If the character already exists in the `hashmap`, the `frequency(value)` of the `character(key)` will will <strong>increment by one</strong>.
3. We must go through each letter of `ransomNote` to see if `magazine` has enough letters to construct `ransomNote`.
4. Retrieving the `frequency` of the `letter` from the `hashmap`, if there is no such letter left in `magazine`, then we `return false`. Otherwise, we update the `frequency` of that `letter` to be <strong>one less than</strong> it was as if <strong>removing</strong> the letter from its pile.
