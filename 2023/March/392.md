## 392. Is Subsequence


### _Description_
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` <i>if `s` is a <strong>subsequence</strong> of `t`, or `false` otherwise</i>.

A <strong>subsequence</strong> of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"<u>a</u>b<u>c</u>d<u>e</u>"` while `"aec"` is not).


#### Example 1 :
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

#### Example 2 :
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```


#### Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 104`
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

#### Follow up:
Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s1, s2, ...`, `sk` where k >= 10<sup>9</sup>, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
