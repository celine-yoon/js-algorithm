## 876. Middle of the Linked List


### _Description_

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return <i>the middle node of the linked list</i>.\
If there are two middle nodes, return <strong>the second middle</strong> node.


#### Example 1 :
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

#### Example 2 :
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

#### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
