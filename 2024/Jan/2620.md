## 2620. Counter


### _Description_

Given an integer `n`, return a `counter` function. This `counter` function initially returns `n` and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (`n`, `n + 1`, `n + 2`, etc).

#### Example 1 :
```
Input: 
n = 10 
["call","call","call"]
Output: [10,11,12]
Explanation: 
counter() = 10 // The first time counter() is called, it returns n.
counter() = 11 // Returns 1 more than the previous time.
counter() = 12 // Returns 1 more than the previous time.
```

#### Example 2 :
```
Input: 
n = -2
["call","call","call","call","call"]
Output: [-2,-1,0,1,2]
Explanation: counter() initially returns -2. Then increases after each subsequent call.
```

#### Constraints:

- `-1000 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= calls.length <= 1000`
- <code>calls[i] === "call"</code>
